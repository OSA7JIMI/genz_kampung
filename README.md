# genz_kampung: Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus (URECA) '23-24 @NTU
## Research into the posting behaviours and habits of Singaporean and international students on Reddit
- As the main purpose of this repository is instructive instead of archival, some code has been cleaned up for readability/optimization and may not be exactly what was used during the research
- All code outputs have been removed to conceal identifying information and preserve the privacy of the Reddit users involved

### Order of Usage:
1. get_reddit_data
2. get_active_users_data 
3. classify_subreddits
4. calculate_shifts_drifts
5. display_graphs
   
- TODO add non-code files: manual_subreddits.csv, Gen-Z Kampung.pdf, topic_definitions.txt
- TODO optimize #5 pandas code and add classplot.ipynb to it
- TODO write down the mathematical reason for occasional calculation failure in #4 (vaguely, some division by zero error)
