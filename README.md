# genz_kampung: Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus (URECA) '23-24 @NTU
## Research into the posting behaviours and habits of Singaporean and international students on Reddit
As the main purpose of this repository is practical instead of archival, some code has been cleaned up for readability/optimization and may not be exactly what was used during the research. All identifying information has been removed to preserve the privacy of the Reddit users involved

### Order of Usage:
1. get_reddit_data
2. get_active_users_data 
3. classify_subreddits
4. calculate_shifts_drifts
5. display_graphs
   
- TODO add non-code files: manual_subreddits.csv, Gen-Z Kampung.pdf, topic_definitions.txt
- TODO optimize display_graphs pandas code and add classplot.ipynb to it
- TODO add mathematical reason for occasional calculation failure (some division by zero error)
